### Pre-commit Setup

Configured comprehensive pre-commit hooks with:
- **Husky** - Git hooks management
- **lint-staged** - Run tasks on staged files
- **ESLint** - JavaScript linting
- **Prettier** - Code formatting

### Pre-commit Actions

The `.husky/pre-commit` hook runs:
1. `lint-staged` - Runs on staged files:
   - ESLint with auto-fix
   - Prettier formatting
   - Related Jest tests
2. Unit tests
3. E2E tests  
4. Coverage check (must be 100%)

### Configuration Files Added

- `.eslintrc.js` - ESLint configuration
- `.prettierrc` - Prettier configuration
- `.prettierignore` - Files to ignore for Prettier
- `jest.config.js` - Updated with coverage thresholds
- `test/setup.js` - Global test setup

### Package.json Scripts

Added the following npm scripts:
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run lint:fix` - Run ESLint with auto-fix
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `npm run format:check` - Check formatting
- `npm run test:unit` - Run unit tests only
- `npm run test:e2e` - Run E2E tests only
- `npm run test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage report

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test suite
npx jest test/server.test.js

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

## Coverage Status

Current coverage focuses on:
- `server.js` - Main server file
- `public/js/connection-worker.js` - 100% coverage
- `public/js/output-handler.js` - 100% coverage
- `public/js/terminal-persistence.js` - Needs coverage

To achieve 100% coverage on all files, you'll need to:
1. Run the full test suite on server.js
2. Complete terminal-persistence.js tests
3. Add any missing edge cases

## Git Workflow

With pre-commit hooks installed:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your message"
# Pre-commit hooks will run automatically
# If any test fails or coverage is below 100%, commit will be aborted
```

## Next Steps

1. Fix any remaining test failures
2. Achieve 100% code coverage on all included files
3. Add integration tests if needed
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
