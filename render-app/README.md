   - New ‚Üí Web Service
   - Connect your GitHub repo
   - Set root directory: `render-app`
   - Build command: `npm install`
   - Start command: `npm start`

3. **Environment Variables** (in Render dashboard):
   ```
   TERMINAL_HOST=142.93.249.123
   TERMINAL_PORT=7681
   SESSION_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
   PASSWORD_HASH=$2a$10$xK1.BKDWYUQvtVl.W3Mjz.8rZKgX6IH5EYXL3jN8ifYJnL3GpXWlm
   ```

   Default password is `terminal123`. To change:
