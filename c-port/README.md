# CloudTerm C Port - Progress Report

## âœ… Completed

1. **Architecture Design** - Created comprehensive design with O(1)/O(log n) complexity focus
2. **Project Structure** - Set up modular C project with optimized Makefile
3. **Core Utilities Implemented**:
   - **Memory Pool** (`mem_pool.c`) - O(1) allocation/deallocation
   - **Lock-free Ring Buffer** (`ring_buffer.c`) - Zero-copy I/O buffering
   - **Hash Table** (`hash_table.c`) - O(1) lookups with FNV-1a and MurmurHash3
   - **Red-Black Tree** (`rb_tree.c`) - O(log n) session expiry management
4. **Event Loop** (`event_loop.c`) - High-performance epoll/kqueue implementation
5. **Main Server** (`main.c`) - Command-line interface and configuration

## ðŸš§ In Progress

### Next Steps:
1. **HTTP Parser** - Zero-copy HTTP request/response parsing
2. **WebSocket Implementation** - Frame parsing and masking
3. **Session Management** - With BCrypt authentication
4. **Connection Management** - Request processing pipeline
5. **Static File Server** - Memory-mapped files with LRU cache
6. **WebSocket Proxy** - Zero-copy proxying to terminal backend

## Architecture Highlights

- **Zero-copy I/O** throughout the stack
- **Lock-free data structures** for concurrent operations
- **Memory pools** to eliminate allocation overhead
- **Platform-optimized** (epoll on Linux, kqueue on macOS/BSD)
- **Cache-friendly** algorithms and data layouts

## Build Instructions

```bash
# Debug build
make MODE=debug

# Release build (optimized)
make

# Run tests
make test

# Profile-guided optimization
make pgo-generate
./bin/cloudterm  # Run with typical workload
make pgo-use
```

## Performance Goals

- 100K+ concurrent connections
- < 1ms WebSocket message latency
- 10Gbps+ static file throughput
- < 100MB memory for 10K sessions

## Current Status

The foundation is solid with all core data structures implemented for optimal performance. The event loop is ready and can handle massive concurrent connections. Next phase focuses on HTTP/WebSocket protocol implementation.
