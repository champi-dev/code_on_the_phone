# Quantum Terminal - Elite Rust Architecture

## Core Design Principles

This architecture achieves O(1) or O(log n) complexity for all operations through careful data structure selection and algorithmic design.

## Data Structures

### 1. Session Management - O(1) Operations
```rust
// Primary session storage - O(1) lookup by UUID
sessions: HashMap<Uuid, Arc<RwLock<Session>>>,

// Secondary index for O(1) user lookups
user_sessions: HashMap<UserId, HashSet<Uuid>>,

// Pre-allocated session pool for O(1) allocation
session_pool: Vec<Box<Session>>,
```

### 2. Command History - O(1) Access
```rust
// Circular buffer with fixed capacity
history_buffer: [Command; HISTORY_SIZE],

// Hash-based deduplication index
dedup_index: HashMap<u64, usize>, // command_hash -> buffer_index

// Bloom filter for O(1) existence check before hash lookup
bloom_filter: BloomFilter<BLOOM_SIZE>,
```

### 3. WebSocket Connections - Zero-Copy Design
```rust
// Lock-free connection pool
connection_pool: crossbeam::queue::ArrayQueue<Connection>,

// Pre-allocated message buffers
message_buffers: slab::Slab<BytesMut>,

// MPSC channels for zero-copy message passing
tx_channels: HashMap<ConnId, mpsc::UnboundedSender<Bytes>>,
```

### 4. Command Execution - O(log k) Trie
```rust
// Trie for command completion (k = command length)
command_trie: Trie<CommandMetadata>,

// Pre-computed command cache
command_cache: HashMap<u64, CompiledCommand>,

// Execution thread pool with work-stealing
executor: rayon::ThreadPool,
```

### 5. Process Management - B+ Tree
```rust
// B+ tree for O(log n) lookups with range queries
processes: BTreeMap<ProcessId, Process>,

// Priority queue for scheduling (binary heap)
scheduler: BinaryHeap<ScheduleEntry>,

// Lock-free process stats
stats: AtomicProcessStats,
```

## Performance Optimizations

### Memory Layout
- Cache-aligned structures using `#[repr(align(64))]`
- Arena allocation for short-lived objects
- Memory pools for frequent allocations

### Concurrency Strategy
- Lock-free data structures where possible
- RwLock for read-heavy workloads
- Atomic operations for statistics
- Actor model for session isolation

### Zero-Copy Techniques
- `bytes::Bytes` for message passing
- Memory-mapped files for large outputs
- Direct syscalls bypassing standard library overhead

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Network Layer (O(1) operations)
- Token bucket rate limiting with pre-allocated slots
- Connection pooling with bounded queues
- Binary protocol with fixed-size headers

### 2. Session Layer (O(1) operations)
- Pre-allocated session objects
- Copy-on-write for session cloning
- Lock-free session statistics

### 3. Execution Layer (O(log n) worst case)
- Work-stealing thread pool
- Command caching with LRU eviction
- Speculative execution for common patterns

### 4. Storage Layer (O(1) amortized)
- Log-structured merge tree for persistence
- Write-ahead log with group commit
- Compressed snapshots with incremental updates

## Algorithmic Complexity Guarantees

| Operation | Complexity | Implementation |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| Session Creation | O(1) | Pre-allocated pool |
| Command Lookup | O(log k) | Trie traversal |
| History Access | O(1) | Hash index |
| Message Send | O(1) | Lock-free queue |
| Process Spawn | O(log n) | B+ tree insert |
| Stats Update | O(1) | Atomic operations |

## Build Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Core data structures with benchmarks
2. **Phase 2**: Network layer with zero-copy
3. **Phase 3**: Session management and execution
4. **Phase 4**: Persistence and recovery
5. **Phase 5**: Performance optimization and profiling

Each phase includes comprehensive benchmarks proving O(1) or O(log n) complexity.
